READ ME FT_PRINTF_TEST

Who to use ?

	Files tests are only simple main you can use like main test.


Tests explanations :

	Each files test one type of converter.
	I have try to list each possible flag combination include warning/error possibilities,
	!!! but Bonus are no supported. !!!

	Each posibility have two lines. Look the line header.

	The first part say what is the output
		first  line on two 'my42 : ' is your ft_printf output.
		second line on two 'nati : ' is the native printf output.

	The second part start with '%' and finish zith '|' is what you tried to put. exemple :
		'%0-10.7i  : |'

	Last part after '|' is the output.

	At the end of each files you have a get crazy test
		Each two first lines on four haven't header and there are the same things like others test parts
		Here we test if your ft_printf can use two converters and the ft_printf return.

you can comment in the files the line you don t want test. i hope that will help you.
